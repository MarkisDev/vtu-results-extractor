# Disclaimer
**I am not responsible for any of the issues caused during or by the usage of this tool. This tool has been solely created to make result extraction easy and feasible to perform analysis.**

# What is this?
This is a tool built using Python in order to extract and export results of multiple students to perform analysis. It has an intelligent system to prevent false positives and does not scrape already accessed USN's.

# Pre-requisites
- THis tool has been developed to work on Windows systems - for other systems, you will have to port the code accordingly.
- This tool has two dependencies - [Tessaract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and [Imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows) in order to function properly. 
- Please ensure that you download and install it in your `C:\Program Files` directory.

# How do I use this?
 - This tool has been packaged as a windows binary file (exe file) which can be downloaded here.
 - Please ensure that you do not spam the results website, ideally you do not want to scrape more than 30 USN's in one sitting.
 - **For reval results** please ensure you __check the box__. This is not necessary when generating the csv/excel file.
